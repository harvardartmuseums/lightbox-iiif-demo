# IIIF Image API Demo

This demo uses the IIIF Image API to split large master image files across multi screen digital signs and video walls. It illustrates how parts of an image can be distributed across many screens and independent systems through simple modifications to the master image URL. It also shows how bezel compensation for video walls can be handled directly with IIIF.
